BACKSTORY

*1979 - 1985 CE: The First Contact War, a clandestine conflict waged by an international coalition known as the Planetary Defense Force. The defeat and reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial technology advances technology by leaps and bounds into previously unimagined territories. Most notable are the military applications, including practical handheld laser weaponry and new composites and alloys, as well as the foundations of the Internet and great strides in miniaturization.

*1989 - 1999 CE: The collapse of WARPAC and its associated allies. The PRC remains a threat, and the Cold War does not end.

*2005 - 2020: Resource crises and overpopulation spur the movement toward space colonization. NATO, along with many unaffiliated nations, join the race to claim what are termed "Lagrangian points". The theories and concepts that would come to define the distant future, including things like the ideal O'Neill cylinder and other hypothetical colonies, are devised, and the idea of permanent settlements on the moon and Mars make great headway. The untapped potential of these distant places are scrutinized. The first moon "colony", really a temporary lunar habitat intended as a proof of concept, is the first to attempt mining off-earth.

Tensions rise between the great powers -- China, India, and Russia form the Tripartite Pact, a military-economic alliance which butts heads with NATO and OPAC over resource rights. The Cold War enters a new era.

*2021 - 2038 CE: The UN is dissolved in 2021 as all the "permanent" members withdraw from proceedings as they reach a deadlock. Proxy wars are fought -- a civil war in Iran resulting in a new Communist government, North Korea overrunning the South, with support from TRIPAC. Vietnam joins TRIPAC after relations collapse with Western nations. As resources continue to run thin, offworld mining projects continue. Recognizing that fossil fuels are bound to run out by the 2040s, the Planetary Defense Force, which has continued low-level operations in the years since the First Contact War, chooses to release fusion technology, and to declassify much of their past operations and discoveries.

However, the PDF is subsequently torn apart as a result of the remaining member nations withdrawing their support for the initiative in light of the defeat of the extraterrestrials. Despite miniaturized fusion paving the way for resource security, supplemented by offworld mining, the spread is not fast enough. By 2037, NATO and OPAC are on the verge of a war with TRIPAC and its allies. 

*2039 - 2041 CE: What is later referred to as "The Great Mistake" was originally understood as the Third World War. An all out war over aquatic resource deposits and disputed territories, as well as various other grievances, plunges most of the world into war. Liberal use of nuclear weaponry by TRIPAC spurs NATO to utilize its own stockpiles, all purely on the tactical level. Nonetheless, within these three years, half the Earth's population is dead. Major cities are summarily wiped out.

Civil unrest in all the countries involved spills into what is now known as "the Chaos", during which the old regimes ceased to exist and new nations rose to replace them. This marks the end of the Common Era.

*0000 - 0214 NCE: The New Common Era was born on September the 23rd of 2041. The first two centuries are marked by the steady recovery of the Earth. With the political landscape forever changed, new initiatives are born of their own accord, new laws, new apparatuses. The remains of the PDF brings together many of the new nations and, by the mid-2nd century, have essentially formed what would later become the Terrasphere Federation. Great strides are again being made in the sciences, and exploration of the Solar System continues unabated from that point forward, after having been stopped as a result of the Great Mistake. It is in January of 0214 that a major leap is made -- the first space colony is finally completed after three decades in construction. An O'Neill Cylinder at the L5 point. It is formally owned by the PDF, and the colony is dubbed "Goddard".

*0220 - 0375 NCE: The Terrasphere Federation is formed in earnest in 0220, finally uniting the planet under a single banner. In the ensuing century and a half, interplanetary travel is continually perfected and more colonies are erected at each Lagrangian point. Each is given (retroactively) designations following the scheme BN-XX where B is the system the colony is a part of, N is the lagrangian point at which the colony cluster at which the cylinder is situated, and XX is the unique identifier code. Over time, as many as twenty cylinders make up an entire cluster, as was the case with the L1 cluster. L represents "Lunar", S represents "Solar". Emigration has already been in progress for over a century by this point.

The first permanent settlement on, and plans for the terraformation of, Mars is completed by 0375. Mining operations begin.

*0381 - 0490 NCE: The need for a peacekeeping force in the Terrasphere spurs the PDF to create the Terrasphere Federation Space Forces. While military ship designs had existed for centuries prior, it is the first time an organized military has made use of them. The PDF proper is reformed into the Terrasphere Federation Ground Forces soon after the TFSF's formation. In the following century, fleets are erected for various purposes, and non-colony space stations are also built as ports and docks for the assembly, stowage, and resupply of the TSFS's ships.

*0632 NCE: The backdrop to the Terrasphere Civil War begins in October after the bombing of various military facilities by separatists, a reaction to gradual tightening of TFSF control over the Colonials, who have been degraded and treated as second class citizens for several centuries. For a year, more and more colony cylinders fall to the sway of the Colonial Liberation Front, or CLF. While the TFSF does not directly intervene, it is clear that the CLF intends to eventually declare independence.

*0633 NCE, February - August: Parts of the TFSF defect to the CLF. The entire 5th, 4th, and 2nd fleets (Martian Garrison Fleet, Contralunar Combat Fleet, and Contrasolar Patrol Fleet) defect. Most of the colonies associated with these fleets immediately declare their independence and form the Lunar Anti-Terran Alliance (LATA).

*0633 NCE, September: The Terrasphere Civil War begins in earnest as the Terrasphere Crisis Evaluation Council deems LATA to be in open rebellion.
